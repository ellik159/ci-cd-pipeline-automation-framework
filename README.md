## TODO

- Add GitLab CI support
- Better error messages
- Web dashboard (maybe)
- More framework detection

## Notes

This started as a weekend project but grew more complex than expected. The analyzer part was trickier to get right - detecting frameworks reliably is harder than it seems.

Based on patterns from various open-source projects I've worked with.
